However, many renderers -- like Github\u0026rsquo;s and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.  Inline code has back-ticks around it.\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they\u0026rsquo;re easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n```javascript var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\"; alert(s); ``` ​```python s = \"Python syntax highlighting\" print s ``` ``` No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let's throw in a \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;tag\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;. ```  var s = \u0026quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting\u0026quot;; alert(s);  s = \u0026quot;Python syntax highlighting\u0026quot; print s  No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). But let's throw in a \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;tag\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;.  Tables Tables aren\u0026rsquo;t part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\nColons can be used to align columns. | Tables | Are | Cool | | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| | col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 | | col 2 is | centered | $12 | | zebra stripes | are neat | $1 | There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown. Markdown | Less | Pretty --- | --- | --- *Still* | `renders` | **nicely** 1 | 2 | 3  Colons can be used to align columns.\n   Tables Are Cool     col 3 is right-aligned $1600   col 2 is centered $12   zebra stripes are neat $1    There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.

Horizontal Rule Three or more... --- Hyphens *** Asterisks ___ Underscores  Three or more\u0026hellip;\n Hyphens\n Asterisks\n Underscores\nLine Breaks My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit \u0026lt;Enter\u0026gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You\u0026rsquo;ll soon learn to get what you want. \u0026ldquo;Markdown Toggle\u0026rdquo; is your friend.\nHere are some things to try out:\nHere's a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*. This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
